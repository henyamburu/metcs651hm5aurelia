src/word-count.html
===================

Web page that reads in lines of text entered by users, separates them into words, sorts them, 
and prints them out together with their number of occurrences.

As User enters or changes the text, and word list are automatically or dynamically rendered onto the page.

Takes Aurelia's (http://www.aurelia.io/) skeleton platform example and modified to add styling 
and make  a word count app.
